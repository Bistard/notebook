## What is AI?

Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key elements include:

- **Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.
- **Anomaly detection** - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
- **Computer vision** - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
- **Natural language processing** - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
- **Conversational AI** - The capability of a software "agent" to participate in a conversation.
