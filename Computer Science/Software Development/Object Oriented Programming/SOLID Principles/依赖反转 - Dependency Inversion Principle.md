# 依赖反转 - Dependency Inversion Principle

DIP says

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
>
> Abstract classes should never depend on concrete classes.

This principle allows for decoupling.

Tranditional way would be look like

<img src=".\.images\image-20211122124016592.png" alt="image-20211122124016592" style="zoom:50%;" />

Take an example such as

<img src=".\.images\image-20211122124339027.png" alt="image-20211122124339027" style="zoom:50%;" />
