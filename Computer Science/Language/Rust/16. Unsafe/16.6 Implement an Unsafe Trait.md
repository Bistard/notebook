# Implement an Unsafe Trait

We can use `unsafe` to implement an unsafe trait. **A trait is unsafe when at least one of its methods has some invariant that the compiler can’t verify**. 

We declare that a trait is `unsafe` by adding the `unsafe` keyword before `trait` and marking the implementation of the trait as `unsafe` too:

```rust
unsafe trait Foo {
    // methods go here
}
unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // method implementations go here
}
```

* As an example, recall the `Sync` and `Send` marker traits we discussed in the [“Extensible Concurrency with the `Sync` and `Send` Traits”](../13. Concurrency\13.5 Sync and Send Traits.md) section: the compiler implements these traits automatically if our types are composed entirely of `Send` and `Sync` types. If we implement a type that contains a type that is not `Send` or `Sync`, such as raw pointers, and we want to mark that type as `Send` or `Sync`, we must use `unsafe`.
* Rust can’t verify that our type upholds the guarantees that it can be safely sent across threads or accessed from multiple threads; therefore, we need to do those checks manually and indicate as such with `unsafe`.
