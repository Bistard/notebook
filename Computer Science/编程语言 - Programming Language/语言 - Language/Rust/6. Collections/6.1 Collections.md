# Collections
Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called *collections*. Most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values. 

Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a skill you’ll develop over time.
